# react-weatherapp

# Description
- This is a recreation of my school project (Weather Dashboard) using many different technologies. The front end of this application will be built using React. The back end of this application will be built using ASP.NET Core. The database for this application will be a azureSQL database and the application will be deployed using azure web services.

- This is very different than anything I have yet to build so expect there to be a long delay between commits.

- The weblink to this site will be include in the [usage](#usage) portion of this readme. It probably will not be working a majority of the time as I learn to navigate azure and implement a .NET backend.

# Installation
- After I am finsihed creating this application I will give detailed instructions on how to clone and set the repository up for your own application

# Usage
- If you're feeling froggy and want to see if the website works in its current state, you can try to check it out at https://reactweatherapp.azurewebsites.net/

# Credits
- The UofM Coding Bootcamp for providing follow on courses on C# and .NET which was the baseline for the knowledge I needed to build this
